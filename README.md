Created to hold some experiments in modelling around populations & genetic algorithms

1. genetic-algorithm.py is a python very simple program which simulates a population of genes. The genes are simple strings containing A,G,C,T characters. It runs generations in which each gene produces children with a mutation, and selects the 'fittest' to replace the parent. It is configurable - you can set the population size, number of generations, the 'target' gene, and a 'seed' gene from which the population is descended.
